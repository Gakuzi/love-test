# Project Overview
This is a step-based test application focused on clarity, usability, and modern UI/UX principles.

# Git Workflow
- All development must occur in a dedicated branch named `dev`.
- For each new feature, create a separate branch from `dev` using the format: `feature/<feature-name>`.
- Pull requests must target `dev`, and only stable, reviewed code is merged into `main`.

# UI/UX Standards
- All interfaces must be modern, readable, and thoughtfully designed.
- Questions should be wrapped in a visually distinct gradient box.
- Answers must be displayed in two columns and two lines for better readability.
- A help button with a “?” icon must be present at all times, opening a modal that explains the test purpose and instructions.

# Code Structure
- Each function should be placed in a separate file whenever possible to simplify editing and maintenance.
- Use ES6+ syntax and modular architecture.
- Prefer functional components and avoid inline styles.

# AI Preferences
- Prioritize UX clarity and accessibility.
- Maintain stage-based navigation logic (intro → question → results).
- Avoid merging unrelated UI elements into a single view.
- Respect visual hierarchy and spacing.

# Commit Norms
- Use descriptive commit messages.
- Group related changes together.
- Avoid committing broken or experimental code to `main`.

# Modal Help Content
The help modal must clearly explain:
- What the test is for
- How to take it
- What the user will gain from it
